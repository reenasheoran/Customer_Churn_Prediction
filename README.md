# Customer Churn Predictor
It is a machine learning project that predicts whether the customer will churn or not.
## Motivation
In MBA, I learned that the success of every business is directly/indirectly dependent upon the type and number of customers the company has. **Customer churn**, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. A high customer churn rate indicates that the company is losing its customers rapidly. This churn can be because of myriad reasons, and it is the company that needs to discover these reasons via patterns and trends present in customer data. 
All companies are interested in identifying segments of these customers because the price for acquiring a new customer is usually higher than retaining the old one. For example, if Netflix knows a segment of customers those are at risk of churning, the company could proactively engage them with special offers instead of simply losing them.
## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to design a machine learning model that can accurately predict customers who are most likely to churn.
